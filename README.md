# TicTacToeFrontend - Frontend for Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

This is the frontend for a project I developed as part of my **portfolio**, showcasing my skills in building full-stack applications with real-time capabilities. While my primary expertise lies in **backend development**, where I focus on creating robust, efficient solutions, I implemented the frontend using **Next.js** with **TypeScript** and the **Turbopack** module for enhanced performance. I used **Axios** for handling REST requests and WebSockets for real-time communication to interface seamlessly with the backend.

To ensure the frontend had an excellent design and user experience, I received invaluable assistance from my friend [Guilherme](https://github.com/guilhermehnf), a talented frontend developer, who contributed significantly to the **design** of the application.

You can check out the backend here: [TicTacToe Backend](https://github.com/MikaelMaster/TicTacToeBackend). 🕹️

### About Access to the Game 🚪
At the moment, the game is not hosted, so you can't play it online yet. However, I plan to host it in the future so everyone can join the fun. 🌍

### What’s Inside this Repo? 📂
In this repository, you’ll find the code showcasing how I implemented the user interface and connected it with the backend for real-time gameplay. The project demonstrates my proficiency in **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **WebSockets**, along with other web technologies to create a responsive and dynamic user experience. Feel free to explore the code, and contributions are always welcome! 👨‍💻💡
